// Package workingcontext manages the agent's working context file,
// .spektacular/context.md.
//
// The file belongs entirely to the agent: it records the cross-cutting
// learnings and user answers a session leaves behind for a resumed session to
// read back. The CLI's only involvement is clearing it at the start of a
// fresh workflow.
//
// Where each repo's code lives is deliberately not written here. It is
// reported live by `repo list`, and the "Where the Code Lives" section
// installed into AGENTS.md directs every agent to that command before it
// touches code — so the roster cannot go stale against the registry, and an
// agent gets it whether or not a workflow has ever run in the project.
