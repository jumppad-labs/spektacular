// Ranking lives here, one layer above the store interface, and deliberately not
// inside any store. A store finds candidate documents and reports what evidence
// each one offers; turning that evidence into a comparable number happens once,
// here, alongside the cross-store merge in Set.Search.
//
// The reason is the merge. Set.Search ranks hits from every covered store
// against each other, so every score it sorts must be on the same scale. A
// formula reproduced inside each provider would have to be reproduced exactly,
// and any drift — a different weight, a rounding difference, a forgotten factor —
// would leave the merged ordering quietly wrong rather than visibly broken.
// The precedent is already in store.Hit: Tier, Name and Category are left empty
// by the store because a store has no notion of its caller's addressing scheme.
// It equally has no notion of the stores it will be ranked against, so Score
// belongs in the same group.
//
// A provider therefore implements "find and describe", never "find, describe and
// rank". The cost of that split is a real constraint on future providers: a
// store must be able to report per-term body occurrence counts to take part in
// this ranking at all.

// The tunable constants of the ranking formula. They are named values in one
// place so tuning is a single-site change rather than an edit scattered across
// the scan.

// must agree on term order by construction rather than by convention.

// tagAffinity reports how strongly term matches the best of an entry's tags: 1
// for an exact match, a fraction for a prefix relation, and 0 for everything
// else. Both sides are already lower-cased. Where several tags match, the
// strongest one decides — affinities do not accumulate, or an entry could earn
// several times the tag weight for a single query word.
//
// The relation is bidirectional prefix with proportional partial credit: when
// one string opens the other, the credit is the shorter's length over the
// longer's. So "http" earns four fifths from an "https" tag, and "apple" and
// "apples" find each other at five sixths without either form being written
// down twice.
//
// It is deliberately not a general string-distance measure, and edit distance in
// particular would be actively wrong here. Tags are overwhelmingly short
// technical tokens, which is exactly where edit distance is weakest: it scores
// test/rest and cors/core at 0.75, and tls/tld, dns/dos and api/apt at 0.67 —
// every one of those a pair of unrelated subjects and a plausible tag in this
// codebase. Prefix scores all of them zero while producing identical numbers on
// every pair that should match. Do not "improve" this into a similarity metric.
//
// Two guards keep it honest, and both are load-bearing. The match is anchored at
// the start, so "test" earns nothing from "latest"; and the shorter string must
// reach minPrefixLen, so "go" earns nothing from "golang".
//
// What it does not do is understand words. "route" does not match "routing",
// because "route" is not the opening of "routing" — prefix matching is
// positional, not morphological. Closing that gap needs stemming, which is out
// of scope; the capture flow carries a rule to add a second tag where a form
// differs by more than its ending.
