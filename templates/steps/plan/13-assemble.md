## Step {{step}}: {{title}}

Assemble the three plan documents from the per-section working files you wrote during the earlier steps and stage them to scratch. This step **only assembles and stages** — it writes nothing to the plan store. The next step verifies what you stage here; the write steps after that commit it.

### Step 1: Gather Metadata

Use the `gather-project-metadata` skill to collect: ISO timestamp, git commit, branch, and repository info.
For skill details: `{{config.command}} skill gather-project-metadata`

### Step 2: Determine Feature Slug

Use the `determine-feature-slug` skill to determine the plan file namespace and number.
For skill details: `{{config.command}} skill determine-feature-slug`

### Step 3: Fill in the Three Scaffolds

Assemble all three scaffolds from the per-section working files — no placeholders, no open questions. The working files hold body content only; each scaffold below owns its headings and their order. Drop each working file's content under the matching heading.

**plan.md** ← files under `.spektacular/work/{{plan_name}}/`:
- `conventions.md` → `## Conventions`
- `architecture.md` → `## Architecture & Design Decisions`
- `components.md` → `## Component Breakdown`
- `data_structures.md` → `## Data Structures & Interfaces`
- `implementation_detail.md` → `## Implementation Detail`
- `dependencies.md` → `## Dependencies`
- `testing_approach.md` → `## Testing Approach`
- `milestones.md` + `phases_plan.md` → `## Milestones & Phases`
- `open_questions.md` → `## Open Questions`
- `out_of_scope.md` → `## Out of Scope`
- `## Overview` ← derive from the spec you read in step 01 and your `.spektacular/context.md` notes.

**context.md** ← files under `.spektacular/work/{{plan_name}}/`:
- `phases_context.md` → `## Per-Phase Technical Notes`
- `testing_approach.md` → `## Testing Strategy` (recast at per-phase granularity)
- `## Current State Analysis`, `## Project References`, `## Token Management Strategy`, `## Migration Notes`, `## Performance Considerations` ← your research findings in `research.md` and `.spektacular/context.md`.

**research.md** ← `.spektacular/work/{{plan_name}}/research.md` (it maps directly onto research.md's seven sections).

If a required working file is missing, the matching gathering step was not completed — STOP and complete it before assembling. In particular, confirm both `phases_plan.md` and `phases_context.md` exist, since the phases step writes two files that feed plan.md and context.md respectively.

#### plan.md scaffold

```markdown
{{plan_template}}
```

#### context.md scaffold

```markdown
{{context_template}}
```

#### research.md scaffold

```markdown
{{research_template}}
```

### Step 4: Stage each assembled document to scratch

Using your own `Write` tool, write each assembled document to its scratch path under `.spektacular/tmp/`. These staged files are what the verification step reads and what the write steps commit — **nothing is written to the plan store in this step**:

- plan.md → `.spektacular/tmp/plan_template.md`
- context.md → `.spektacular/tmp/context_template.md`
- research.md → `.spektacular/tmp/research_template.md`

Staging to `.spektacular/tmp/` with your own `Write` tool is correct here. Do **not** run `{{config.command}} plan file write` yet — committing to the plan store happens in the write steps.

Then advance:

```
{{config.command}} plan goto --data '{"step":"{{next_step}}"}'
```

---

**Before you advance:** refresh `.spektacular/context.md` with your cross-cutting working context only — the key decisions and substitutions made, the answers the user gave to your questions, and learnings worth carrying forward. Keep it to learnings and decisions, not a transcript and not a copy of content already captured elsewhere (such as a section's own working file). Use your own file tools. This file is git-tracked, and a resumed session reads it back to pick up where you left off, so keep it current every time before running the `goto` command above.
