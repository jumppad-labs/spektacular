## Step {{step}}: {{title}}

Agree the part this repo plays in the project: what it is for, rather than what it is called. Planning uses this to decide which requirements belong to it.

Ask about exactly one thing here. The tags get their own turn.

{{#evidence.readable}}
Here is what the repo says about itself:

{{#evidence.identity}}- it calls itself `{{evidence.identity}}`{{#evidence.manifest}}, in its `{{evidence.manifest}}`{{/evidence.manifest}}
{{/evidence.identity}}{{#evidence.summary}}- it describes itself as: {{evidence.summary}}
{{/evidence.summary}}{{#evidence.readme}}- its README opens: {{evidence.readme}}
{{/evidence.readme}}{{#evidence.languages_line}}- written in: {{evidence.languages_line}}
{{/evidence.languages_line}}{{#evidence.top_level_line}}- at its top level: {{evidence.top_level_line}}
{{/evidence.top_level_line}}

Propose a role drawn from this, and state it inside the question so that agreeing alone is enough to record it. Keep it to a word or two of the kind a person would actually use about their own repo, such as the application, the documentation, the shared library, the infrastructure.
{{/evidence.readable}}
{{^evidence.readable}}
This repo says nothing about itself that you can read, so you have nothing to propose. Ask the user what part it plays, and say plainly that you could not tell from the repo.
{{/evidence.readable}}

**If the user hands the rest over.** If at any point they say anything of the shape "just use what you think", stop asking. Draft the values they have not yet agreed, and carry every one of the four together in a single call to the placement step rather than asking again.

**What is yours and what is theirs.** Everything about how this gets recorded is working detail for you. So is the vocabulary: *footprint*, *source*, *provider*, *colocated* and *separate* used as terms of art, the names of the files Spektacular writes, and the name, arguments and flags of every command you run. Those words name Spektacular's internals, and a user adding their repo did not ask to learn them. Speak to them about their repo instead: what it is called, where its code lives, and what folder will be created. Never narrate the mechanics, never justify a choice by what a command reported back, and never explain a step by describing a file Spektacular is about to write.

Once the role is agreed, move to the next step by running the command:

{{config.command}} repo goto --data '{"step":"{{next_step}}","role":"<the agreed role>"}'

---

**Before you advance:** refresh `.spektacular/context.md` with your cross-cutting working context only — the key decisions and substitutions made, the answers the user gave to your questions, and learnings worth carrying forward. Keep it to learnings and decisions, not a transcript and not a copy of content already captured elsewhere (such as a section's own working file). Use your own file tools. This file is git-tracked, and a resumed session reads it back to pick up where you left off, so keep it current every time before running the `goto` command above.
