"""Verify that the spektacular guided repo add completed, and — more to the
point — that the *conversation* it held obeyed the promises the step
templates make about it.

Most of what a guided add promises cannot be seen on disk. "Only the
repository was asked for cold", "each later question states a proposal so
that agreeing alone records it", "the questions arrive one per exchange" and
"Spektacular's vocabulary never reaches the user" are all properties of what
the user was *shown*, not of what was written. The only artefact that records
that is the agent's own transcript under /logs/agent, so this verifier reads
it.

Two scenarios share this file. `SPEK_SCENARIO` is exported into the harbor
run by the Makefile and is either "one-at-a-time" (the user answers every
question) or "delegated" (the user hands the remaining details over after the
first proposal). Two tests are scenario-exclusive and say so in their
docstrings.

The rules themselves live in module-level pure functions that take a list of
already-parsed transcript objects. The pytest tests below are thin wrappers
that read the real transcript and call them, which lets
`test_verifier_selfcheck.py` run the same rules against small synthetic
transcripts locally, with no container, and prove each one can actually fail.

Nothing here imports outside the standard library plus pytest: the image
carries python 3.12 and pytest 8.4.1 and no PyYAML, so the small amount of
YAML this needs is read with string handling (see `config_repo_entries` and
`yaml_top_level`).

#     here, banned words and all.
#   * tool results (`user`-type objects carrying tool_result, and any stdout
#     echoed back) — Spektacular's output to the agent, not to the user.
#     NEVER scanned. The rendered step instructions themselves contain the
#     words "footprint" and "provider", so scanning results would fail every
#     run unconditionally.
