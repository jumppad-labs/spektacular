// This is deliberately not internal/metadata, despite the surface similarity,
// and consolidating the two would break one of them.
//
// internal/metadata owns the *workflow artifact* schema — specs, plans,
// changelogs — where a parseable created_date and a status from a fixed enum are
// mandatory and an artifact lacking them genuinely is malformed. Its renderer
// also round-trips through a fixed shape that silently drops unknown keys. Route
// a knowledge entry through it and a tags-only block is rejected as malformed,
// while any write-back deletes the tags.
//
// A knowledge entry has the opposite schema: every field is optional, and an
// entry with no block at all is the normal case rather than an error — which is
// what lets tags ship with no migration, no backfill and no command to run. The
// shared part is about fifteen lines of block detection, copied from
// internal/metadata/frontmatter.go; the divergent part is the schema and its
// validation, which is the part that matters.
//
// A frontmatter block is a document-format concern, not a knowledge-domain one,
// so reading one here does not breach this package's deliberate
// category-agnosticism.

// ParseEntry splits an optional leading YAML frontmatter block off raw,
// returning the tags the entry declares and the remaining body.
//
// An entry with no leading block yields no tags and raw unchanged, which is not
// an error — that is every entry written before tags existed. Nor is an opener
// that is never closed, or a closing marker that is not alone on its line: those
// read as a horizontal rule in prose, so the entry keeps working and simply has
// no tags. Failing a whole search because one entry has a formatting accident
// would be a far worse outcome than missing a tag.
//
// The one case that does return an error is a block that is properly delimited
// but whose YAML will not unmarshal. The tags and body returned alongside it are
// still safe to use — no tags, and the raw bytes as the body — so a caller that
// only wants to keep searching can ignore the error, while a caller auditing
// entries can report it rather than leaving it invisible forever.
//
// tags is normalised: lower-cased, trimmed, emptied entries dropped, duplicates
// removed, first-seen order preserved. Lower-casing on read is what stops "HTTP"
// and "http" ever existing as two separate tags.
