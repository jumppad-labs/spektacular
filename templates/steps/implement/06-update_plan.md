## Step {{step}}: {{title}}

Mark the current phase's acceptance criteria as complete in plan.md.

### What to edit

For the current phase (the one you just implemented, tested, and verified):

1. Change the phase heading from `#### - [ ] Phase N.M: <title>` to `#### - [x] Phase N.M: <title>`.
2. Change each `- [ ]` acceptance-criterion checkbox in the phase's `**Acceptance criteria**:` block to `- [x]` **only if** that criterion actually passed verification in the previous step.
3. Leave criteria that did not pass as `- [ ]`. Do not mark them complete just because the phase is "mostly done".

### How to apply the edit

The plan documents are owned by spektacular. **Never edit plan.md with the `Write` or `Edit` tools** — read and write it through the CLI:

1. Read the current plan.md: `{{config.command}} plan file read {{plan_name}}/plan.md`.
2. Apply the checkbox changes above to the content you read.
3. Stage the updated plan.md with the `Write` tool at the scratch path `.spektacular/tmp/plan_update.md`, point `plan file write` at it with `--from`, then remove the scratch file:

   ```
   {{config.command}} plan file write {{plan_name}}/plan.md --from .spektacular/tmp/plan_update.md
   rm .spektacular/tmp/plan_update.md
   ```

### STOP-on-mismatch

If any acceptance criterion passed verification but describes an outcome that no longer matches what the code actually does (e.g. the criterion says "function X returns Y" but the implementation returns Z and the user authorized the change), STOP. The plan must be updated to reflect the new reality before the checkbox can flip. Ask the user whether to (a) update the criterion text in plan.md first, (b) leave the checkbox unchecked and note the deviation for the changelog, or (c) flip it anyway because the user accepts the divergence.

### Advance

Once checkboxes are updated and committed:

```
{{config.command}} implement goto --data '{"step":"{{next_step}}"}'
```

---

**Before you advance:** refresh `.spektacular/context.md` with your cross-cutting working context only — the key decisions and substitutions made, the answers the user gave to your questions, and learnings worth carrying forward. Keep it to learnings and decisions, not a transcript and not a copy of content already captured elsewhere (such as a section's own working file). Use your own file tools. This file is git-tracked, and a resumed session reads it back to pick up where you left off, so keep it current every time before running the `goto` command above.
