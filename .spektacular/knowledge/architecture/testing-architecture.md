# Testing Architecture: Three Layers and Their Hand-Maintained Couplings

Spektacular's behavior is prose-driven — workflow judgement lives in step templates, not Go — so its test architecture has three layers, each responsible for a different failure class:

1. **Go unit/step tests** (`internal/steps/*/[a-z_]*_test.go`) — deterministic mechanics: FSM step order and wiring, callback behavior, document metadata lifecycle, path helpers. Run with `go test ./...`; always in CI.

2. **Template-contract tests** (`templates/*_test.go` and template-content assertions in `internal/steps/*/steps_test.go`) — the enforcement layer for prose-driven behavior. They assert that rendered step instructions contain (or ban) specific anchor phrases: the context-refresh directive marker, working-file references, approval-gate phrasings, shared instruction blocks. When behavior is expressed as template prose, its regression test is a phrase assertion here. Also `go test ./...`; always in CI.

3. **Harbor E2E suites** (`tests/harbor/plan-workflow`, `tests/harbor/spec-workflow`) — behavioral proof: a real agent drives the full workflow in a Docker container and a pytest verifier asserts against its transcript and artifacts. Run via `make harbor-test-plan` / `make harbor-test-spec`; requires the `harbor` CLI, Docker, and Claude credentials, takes ~20–25 minutes per run, and does **not** run in CI.

The harbor layer is deliberately built on **hand-maintained, independent oracles** — deriving them from the templates at runtime would make the tests tautological. These oracles are couplings to product surfaces and must be updated in the same change as the surface they mirror:

- `EXPECTED_STEP_ORDER`, `EXPECTED_SKILLS_PER_STEP`, `EXPECTED_SPAWN_STEPS` — mirror `internal/steps/*/steps.go` and template skill references
- Command-substring oracles (e.g. `CONVENTIONS_READ_COMMAND`) — mirror CLI commands named in templates
- `SCAFFOLD_LEFTOVERS` literals — mirror `templates/scaffold/*.md` placeholder slots (keep literals distinctive; generic ones false-positive on legitimate prose)
- Seeded environment fixtures (`environment/Dockerfile`, seeded spec/convention files) — must satisfy current store contracts (e.g. spec filenames need a valid `spec.id_method` ID prefix)
- `solution/solve.sh` goto sequence and `task.toml` timeouts — mirror the step table and realistic run length

**Consequence for planning and implementing:** any change to workflow steps, step templates, scaffolds, CLI command names, or store validation contracts includes the harbor suite's matching surfaces in its scope, and its verification includes a harbor run. Because the suites don't run in CI, skipping this doesn't fail anything at the time — drift accumulates invisibly and is paid for by whoever runs the suite next (plan 000040's E2E validation spent four ~25-minute runs clearing four such accumulated drifts).
