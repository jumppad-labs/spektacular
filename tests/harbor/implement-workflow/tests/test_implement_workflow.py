"""Verify the spektacular implement workflow's changelog behaviour end to end.

The environment pre-seeds a multi-repo project (`auth-service`) whose plan
implementation is complete: two phases touched the colocated `auth` repo,
one phase touched the external `docs` repo, all phases are checked off,
and the workflow state is positioned at `test_plan`. The driving agent
runs `/spek:implement` from that point through `finished`.

This verifier is intentionally narrow. It exists to catch the class of
regression that motivated its creation: the implement workflow silently
skipping the changelog write (the finished step used to swallow
store.ErrNotFound and mark the workflow finished with no record on
disk), or writing to the wrong path (the projects PR briefly wrote the
project-level record under a `<project>/` subfolder that collides with
the colocated repo-level write when project root == repo root).

Every oracle here is hand-maintained. Do NOT derive expected paths from
`spektacular` at runtime — that closes the loop and defeats the point of
an independent behavioural check. When the changelog path model changes,
update the constants below in the same commit as the code change.
