## Historical Artifacts: Specs and Plans as Archaeology

In this repository, treat every file under `.spektacular/specs/` and
`.spektacular/plans/` as a historical, archaeological record. Each one
describes the intent behind a past change — *why* something was proposed,
what was in scope at that moment, and how the author framed the problem.
None of them are a description of what the codebase does today. Intent
recorded in a spec or plan may have been reshaped during implementation,
descoped, or abandoned entirely; only the shipped code, its tests, and its
configuration authoritatively describe current behavior.

Because of that, when you are exploring the codebase, summarizing a
feature, tracing how something works, or answering any question about
current-state behavior, do not read files under `.spektacular/specs/` or
`.spektacular/plans/` — through the `Read` tool, through `{{command}} spec
file read`, through `{{command}} plan file read`, or through any other
channel. Ground your answer in source files, tests, and configuration
instead, and cite paths under those directories rather than under the
spec or plan stores.

You may read a historical spec or plan only when the user is genuinely
investigating past intent — questions like "why was X built this way?",
"what was the original plan for Y?", or "which spec introduced Z?". In
that case, read the relevant document, and cite it explicitly as
historical context for a past decision rather than as a description of
current behavior. Archaeology is the only allowed reason to open these
files outside an active workflow.

There is one further exception: while a spec, plan, or implement
workflow is actively running, the workflow that owns its artifact may
read and update that artifact freely. That is what the workflow is for,
and it uses the dedicated CLI (`{{command}} spec file read/write`,
`{{command}} plan file read/write`) to do so. Once the workflow closes —
or for any agent that is not the workflow currently driving the
artifact — the artifact is historical again and subject to the same
rules as every other spec or plan on disk.

This rule applies everywhere you operate in the repository, not only
inside spec, plan, or implement workflow steps. It binds ad-hoc
questions, unrelated skills, and general exploration alike. Users
should not have to restate it in each session.

More broadly, the rest of `.spektacular/` — knowledge entries,
`context.md`, changelog records — is generated output *about* the
codebase, not the codebase itself. A broad grep or file scan run to
understand current-state behavior should treat all of `.spektacular/`
as out of scope, the same way it treats `.spektacular/specs/` and
`.spektacular/plans/` above, unless the task explicitly concerns specs,
plans, or knowledge.
