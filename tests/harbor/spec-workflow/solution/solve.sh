## Overview

Stateless user authentication system using JWT access and refresh tokens.
Replaces the current session-based auth to enable horizontal scaling across
multiple backend services. Benefits backend developers who consume the auth
API and end users who need reliable login across services.

## Requirements

- **Issue access token** — The system issues a signed JWT access token on successful login.
- **Issue refresh token** — The system issues a refresh token alongside the access token.
- **Access token expiry** — Access tokens expire after 15 minutes.
- **Refresh token expiry** — Refresh tokens expire after 7 days.
- **Validate signatures** — The system validates token signatures on every authenticated request.
- **Reject expired tokens** — The system rejects expired tokens with a 401 response.
- **Support revocation** — The system supports token revocation via a deny list.
- **Hash stored tokens** — The system hashes refresh tokens before storing them.

## Constraints

- Must not store access tokens server-side.
- Refresh token storage must use the existing PostgreSQL database.
- Must not break existing API endpoints during migration.
- Token payload must not contain sensitive PII beyond user ID and role.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A user can log in with valid credentials and receive a JWT access token and refresh token.
- [ ] A request carrying an expired access token returns HTTP 401.
- [ ] A valid refresh token can be exchanged for a new access token.
- [ ] A revoked token is rejected on the next authenticated request.
- [ ] Tokens issued by one service instance are accepted by another instance.

## Technical Approach

- Add a new auth package implementing token issuance and validation.
- Use asymmetric RS256 keys stored in environment configuration.
- Implement middleware that validates the Authorization header on protected routes.
- Store refresh tokens in a refresh_tokens PostgreSQL table with hashed values.
- Add /auth/login, /auth/refresh, and /auth/revoke endpoints.
- Use Redis for the token deny list with a TTL matching token expiry.

## Success Metrics

- Token validation adds less than 5ms p99 latency to authenticated requests.
- The auth service sustains 1000 login requests per second.
- Zero downtime during migration from session-based auth.
- All existing integration tests pass after migration.

## Non-Goals

- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect provider support (future work).
- Multi-factor authentication (separate initiative).
- Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Fine-grained permission scoping beyond role-based access.
