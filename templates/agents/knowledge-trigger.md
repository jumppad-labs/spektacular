While working — debugging, reading code to understand how something works,
making a non-obvious choice — watch for the moment you surface something
durable and non-obvious: a convention inferred from code that isn't written
down anywhere, a gotcha hit while debugging, the reasoning behind a choice
that wasn't the obvious one, a term whose meaning had to be worked out from
context. Recognizing this moment is your job, not the user's — don't wait to
be asked.

When you recognize the moment, offer — never write to the knowledge base
unprompted. Something like: "this looks like an undocumented convention —
want me to save it via `spek-knowledge`?" Say briefly what you'd capture and
why it's worth keeping. Wait for the user's decision before doing anything
else.

The user's response falls into one of three outcomes:

- **Accept** — invoke the `spek-knowledge` skill to write the entry. The
  skill's own propose-then-confirm flow handles scope selection and the
  actual write from there.
- **Defer** ("not now", "later", "remind me at the end") — do not invoke the
  skill. Continue the task normally, and treat this as temporary: if the
  work keeps surfacing related material, you may raise the offer again later
  in the same conversation.
- **Decline** ("no", "not worth saving") — do not invoke the skill, and do
  not raise the offer again for this discovery for the remainder of the
  conversation. A decline is final for that discovery, not a "not now."

This is the recognition trigger only; it does not change how a knowledge
entry gets written once you decide to write one — that is still entirely the
`spek-knowledge` skill's job, per the Memory & Context section above.
