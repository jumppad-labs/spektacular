## Step {{step}}: {{title}}

All three plan documents are committed to the plan store. Before the workflow can finish, walk the user through the plan and get their explicit sign-off. This review is mandatory — do not offer it as a choice, and do not skip it because the user seems satisfied.

Begin by reading all three committed documents back through the CLI — ground the review in the committed state, not your memory of drafting it (on a resumed session, this is the only reliable source):

```
{{config.command}} plan file read {{plan_name}}/plan.md
{{config.command}} plan file read {{plan_name}}/context.md
{{config.command}} plan file read {{plan_name}}/research.md
```

Present the plan as a colleague would explain it aloud, not as a recitation of `{{plan_path}}`'s section text. Pace it as a small number of natural beats with a brief pause between each, rather than one uninterrupted monologue or a rigid sign-off gate after every point:

1. The chosen approach and why it was picked over the alternatives.
2. How the work breaks into stages/phases.
3. What was deliberately left out of scope, and why.
4. The drafting assumptions — the judgement calls made while drafting. Read the `## Drafting assumptions` section of `{{research_path}}` (via `{{config.command}} plan file read {{plan_name}}/research.md`) and walk its entries one by one — decision, rationale, rejected alternatives — inviting the user to challenge each. This beat is first-class: raise the assumptions explicitly rather than leaving them as a section the user could read. A challenged assumption is a change request — handle it through the apply-immediately path below.

At any point during the walkthrough, the user may interrupt with a question or a request to change something. Respond to it directly in your next message before returning to the beat you were on. If the interruption is a change request, apply it immediately rather than deferring it: edit the affected section, stage the updated document under `.spektacular/tmp/`, commit it with `{{config.command}} plan file write {{plan_name}}/plan.md --from <scratch>` (or the same command against `context.md`/`research.md` for changes landing there), confirm the update to the user, remove the scratch file, then resume the walkthrough, re-summarizing anything the change affected. Never write or edit the plan documents with the `Write` or `Edit` tools — `{{config.command}} plan file write` is the only supported way to write them.

Only conclude the walkthrough once the user gives an explicit affirmative answer to a direct closing question (e.g. "does this look right, ready to proceed?"). Silence, a topic change, or an ambiguous reply is not agreement — keep the walkthrough open until they explicitly confirm. If the session is interrupted mid-review, the workflow stays on this step and a later session resumes the walkthrough here.

Once the user has explicitly signed off, advance to the finished step:

```
{{config.command}} plan goto --data '{"step":"{{next_step}}"}'
```

---

**Before you advance:** refresh `.spektacular/context.md` with your cross-cutting working context only — the key decisions and substitutions made, the answers the user gave to your questions, and learnings worth carrying forward. Keep it to learnings and decisions, not a transcript and not a copy of content already captured elsewhere (such as a section's own working file). Use your own file tools. This file is git-tracked, and a resumed session reads it back to pick up where you left off, so keep it current every time before running the `goto` command above.
